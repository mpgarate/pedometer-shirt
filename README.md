Pedometer Shirt
===============

Arduino code for a t-shirt gamifying daily step counting. The shirt has an RGB LED progress bar across the chest which displays progress toward a goal. When the goal is reached, the shirt shows a celebratory animation. 

[Whitney](https://github.com/whitnepenn) made the shirt with conductive thread, an Arduino Flora, and neopixels. We hacked a pedometer to a switch connected to the flora, and used a battery pack so that the shirt works without USB connection.
